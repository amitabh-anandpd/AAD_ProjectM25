# Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm

## Definition

The Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm is an efficient way to compute max-flow for computer vision-related graphs. It is an augmenting paths-based algorithm. It was introduced by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov in their famous paper “An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision”.

# Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm

## What is the Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm?

The Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm is an efficient way to compute max-flow for computer vision-related graphs. It is an augmenting paths-based algorithm which works by finding and pushing flow aloong shortest paths from a source to a sink in a graph until no more paths can be found. It was introduced by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov in their famous paper “An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision”.
